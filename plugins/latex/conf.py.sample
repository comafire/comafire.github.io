# Determines how the formulae are rendered. Possibilities:
#  - "latex_formula_image_renderer": renders formulae as graphics and includes them.
#  - "latex_formula_mathjax": inserts MathJax code.
LATEX_FORMULA_RENDERER = "latex_formula_image_renderer"

# When "latex_formula_image_renderer" is selected as the formula renderer,
# the formulae colors and scale can be set here:
#
# The color must be given as an RGB triple with components in range [0, 1].
# Here, (0, 0, 0) is black and (1, 1, 1) is white.
LATEX_FORMULA_COLOR = (0., 0., 0.)
#
# The formula scale determines the effective size of the formulae.
# Check what looks good with your theme's main font.
LATEX_FORMULA_SCALE = 1.25
#
# The engine determines the TeX engine used. Must be one of "latex", "luatex" and "xetex".
# Note that "luatex" does not support pstricks formulae.
LATEX_FORMULA_ENGINE = "latex"
